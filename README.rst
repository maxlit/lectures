Finance through algorithmic lens
---------------------

**What is it all about?**

This is a presentation on the use of algorithms (or rather algorithmic thinking) in finance.
The first half of the lecture is focused on the short introduction to the algorithmic thinking, what is the "speed" of the algorithm, what is the "hardness" of the algorithm etc.

The second half is focused on the application cases of algorithmic thinking in quantitative finance and also on theoretical insights it gives.
